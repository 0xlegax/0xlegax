### Hi.

Hi.
I'm 0xlegax, an aspiring blockchain security researcher with a deep interest in zero-knowledge cryptography and smart contract security. I'm currently building with Solidity and learning Rust.

While I'm not affiliated with any platforms just yet, I'm actively developing my skills and looking for ways to contribute to the ecosystem.

### 🚀 Open to Collaborations

Whether it’s audits, security research, or experimental collabs—I'm always down to connect and work on meaningful projects.
